# Personal collection of helper functions for algorithmic art.

This package gathers few functions to generate aesthetic graphical outputs with R. They are roughly organized by systems (e.g. functions to work with curves, sequences, differential equations), pending a more relevant structure and documentation.

To promote an open-ended use of this package, I open-sourced a set of reproducible outputs in an illustrative [repository](https://github.com/picasa/generative_examples). Additional examples are presented on my art [website](https://casadebaig.netlify.app/), more to explain the logic underlying the algorithms rather than step by step code.

This package is released under a [BSD](https://github.com/picasa/generate/blob/main/LICENSE.md) licence.
