\title{Detect top local maxima with noise filtering}
\usage{
l_max(x, n = 5, w = 20, delta = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of values}

\item{n}{Number of top maxima to return}

\item{w}{Window size for rolling mean smoothing (larger values = more smoothing)}

\item{delta}{Maximum allowed deviation between raw and smoothed values for noise filtering}
}
\value{
Logical vector of same length as x, TRUE for top n local maxima
}
\description{
Identifies local maxima in a time series by comparing each point to its
neighbors and filtering based on deviation from a smoothed trend.
}
\examples{
# Generate sample data with peaks
x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 8, 6, 2, 7, 3)
l_max(x, n = 2, w = 3, delta = 2)
}
