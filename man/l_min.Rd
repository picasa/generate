\title{Detect top local minima with noise filtering}
\usage{
l_min(x, n = 5, w = 20, delta = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of values to analyze}

\item{n}{Number of top minima to return}

\item{w}{Window size for rolling mean smoothing (larger values = more smoothing)}

\item{delta}{Maximum allowed deviation between raw and smoothed values for noise filtering}
}
\value{
Logical vector of same length as x, TRUE for top n local minima
}
\description{
Identifies local minima in a time series by comparing each point to its
neighbors and filtering based on deviation from a smoothed trend. Returns
a logical vector indicating the top n minima.
}
\examples{
# Generate sample data with valleys
x <- c(5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 1, 3)
l_min(x, n = 2, w = 3, delta = 2)
}
